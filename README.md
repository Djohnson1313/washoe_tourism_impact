# Business Understanding 
This repository and notebook intend to dive into the economics of the Washoe Valley area within Northern Nevada using data collected on tourism and the income it generates. This will primarily be done through breaking down how tourists spend their money by category, which include : `Food and Beverage`, `Gaming`, `Lodging`, `Recreation` and `Retail`. This information allows local businesses to target a specific demographic of tourists they belive they can best serve, therefore bringing more money and people into the economy of northern Nevada.

## Evaluation
Here we can see several interesting datapoints, firstly noting that gaming (and in the context on nevada, gambling) is the highest incomde generator for what Washoe County area, followed by retail and lodging. This is backed up by the fact that gaming in responsible for 23% of all revenue generated from tourism, with retial at 18% and lodging at 16%. We can also notice a bit of a counter intuitive metric, which is that spending within the Washoe County rised turing the COVID-19 pandemic. This goes against all understanig of the time, which is that COVID-19 absolutley decimated tourism spending throughout the world. So, is Washoe County an exceptipn to this rule, or is there something else at play. While this realization woudld take a much deeper dive into the economics of Nevada as a whole, we can say for certain that this data could be infuenced by indirect economic spending, dalayed reporting from businesses as well as stimulus driven spending. 

# Conclusion
In conclusion, gaming is absolutely the selling point of the Washoe Valley area, incentivizing local businesses to ensure gambling plays a part in there overall business plan if they wish to ensure their success and a larger piece of the proverbial pie.
